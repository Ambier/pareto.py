Things I'd like to change about Jon's nondom sort:

memorize epsilon boxes
get rid of globals
librarify
multiple input files
different column spec by input file
needs -h
Minimum python version? Maximum python version?
Minimum numpy version? Maximum numpy version?
better column spec syntax -- ranges are good
Change the name of the project in the license text away from SALib
clarify column numbering (count from one)
