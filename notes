Things I'd like to change about Jon's nondom sort:

memorize epsilon boxes
get rid of globals
librarify
multiple input files
different column spec by input file
needs -h
Minimum python version? Maximum python version? <= 3.0 because of print
	Same behavior with python2 as 3 if I get rid of the prints?
Minimum numpy version? Maximum numpy version?
better column spec syntax -- ranges are good
Change the name of the project in the license text away from SALib
clarify column numbering (count from zero)
raise exceptions on bad input
allow an input spec file?

external utility to compare output files

PEP8

clarify that objectives are to be minimized
